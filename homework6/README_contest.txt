HOMEWORK 6 CONTEST: INVERSE WORD SEARCH


NAME:  <Anannya Punia>


OPTIMIZATIONS:
What did you do?
I'm sorry but I didn't do a lot just because this week has been hard for me and haven't had the time. My grandma died and I have not done anything on this homework

TEST CASE SUMMARY:
How did your program perform on the different test cases?  Summarize
the running times.  (It's ok if it didn't finish the harder examples.)
What new test cases did you create and how did it perform on those
tests?

They didn't really perform
