ALGORITHM ANALYSIS:
What's the order notation of your algorithm?
depending on the number of the for loops and the nested for loops. I think my very incomplete program is only o(n^3) but a completed version would be a lot more run time 




TEST CASE SUMMARY:
How did your program perform on the different test cases?  Summarize
the running times.  (It's ok if it didn't finish the harder examples.)
What new test cases did you create and how did it perform on those
tests?
It depends on how many words you have in your vectors. i perfomred no test cases. 



MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!
The extension I had wasn't enough so I tried my best and this is what I have.
